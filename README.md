# Unit 4 Project: Physics Questions Sharing Social Media

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

I am a high school student living in Karuizawa. In our school quarter of our grade takes physics in International Baccaulaurate Diploma Program(IBDP). Due to restrictions from the curriculum the students are having a hard time to find proper questions that are alligned with IB standards. And whenever the students share questions with each other using SNS like messenger or instagram it's really hard to revisit the same question again and also to pass it down to our juniors. Because of these issues a need was risen for a social networking system to share physics questions within ourselves

## Proposed Solution

Considering the client's requirements, an adequate solution 
Graphical User Interface) that can store data into a database. Python would be an adequate programming language for the
solution as it is open source, it is mature and supported in multiple platforms (platform-independent) including macOS,
Windows, Linux.[^2]For the database, SQLite would be an adequate solution as it is an embedded, serverless relational
database which means the program and the database can be both localized.[^3]To interface with the SQLite database,
SQLAlchemy is the choice to go as it support ORM(Object Relational Mapper). An ORM is a database abstraction layer that
sits as an intermediary between the code and the database engine[^4], which simple queries and makes the code more
concise. As for the GUI, KivyMD is chosen for its elegant and simpleness. This GUI framework uses is structured in
object-oriented format and makes the development easy[^5]

## Computational Thinking

#### Decomposition

In computational thinking, decomposition refers to breaking a complex problem or system into parts that are easier to
conceive, understand, program, and maintain.

#### Pattern recognition, generalization and abstraction

#### Algorithms

An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task. Development
